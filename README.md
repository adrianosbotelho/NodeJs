Course Node.js: The Complete Guide to Build RESTful APIs (2018)
Learn to build fast, scalable and secure RESTful services with Node, Express and MongoDB, from setup to production

What is Node.js?

Node.js, or Node, is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
It is ideal for building highly-scalable, data-intensive backend services (APIs) that power your client’s apps
(web or mobile apps).


Why learn Node?

Node is great for prototyping and agile development as well as building super fast and highly scalable apps; 
Companies like Uber and PayPal use Node in production to build applications because it requires fewer people and less code. 
Plus, Node has the largest ecosystem of open-source library, so you don’t have to build everything from scratch.
